# Final Project Assignment - Group 12:
This is our final group assignment for the Data Visualization and Storytelling course at LBS (MAM 2024).

In a world brimming with diverse cultures, economies, and environments, the quest for happiness remains a universal endeavor. Our group's project embarks on an exploratory journey through the World Happiness Reports from 2015 to 2022. These reports, an amalgam of data, surveys, and research, offer a unique lens to view the changing landscapes of global happiness.

The database we are using is the World Happiness Report from 2015 to 2022, and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayzannilarthein44/world-happiness-report-2015-to-2022/

We also used Global Country Information Dataset 2023 to draw additional insights: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023
